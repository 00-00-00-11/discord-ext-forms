Making a Basic Reaction Form
============================

::

    @bot.command()
    async def reactionform(ctx):
        embed=discord.Embed(title="Reaction Menu Test",description="Delete 20 messages?") # Let's make our embed here...
        message = await ctx.send(embed=embed) # And send it! But we want to capture it as a variable!
        form = ReactionForm(message,bot,ctx.author) # Initialize the reaction form...
        form.add_reaction("✅",True) # Add the ✅ reaction which will return True.
        form.add_reaction("❌",False) # Add the ❌ reaction which will return False.
        choice = await form.start() # Start the form! Choice will be True or False based on the input.
        if choice: # If choice is true:
            await ctx.channel.purge(limit=20) # delete 20 messages!
