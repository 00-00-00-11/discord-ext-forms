# How to contribute
To contribute, fork the project:
![How to Fork](https://mikey.has-no-bra.in/ap8oYB.gif)

Once you've forked it, a new repository will be available under your name! Once you make the edits to your repository, submit a pull request. All that's left is for me to look over your code!

**Working on your first Pull Request?** You can learn how from this *free* series [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://kcd.im/pull-request)
